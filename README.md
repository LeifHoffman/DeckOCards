# DeckOCards
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Leif Hoffman and this is a program I'm working on for one of my classes. For now, I'm calling the program "Deck O Cards" since that's what the program simulates; cards! As of currently, my program has two games that use a standard deck of 52 playing cards, War and Scoundrel. War is a classic game that most people know, but Scoundrel is likely one you haven't heard of. I may plan on adding more games in the future, but hopefully you will enjoy the ones that are currently available!
