# DeckOCards
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Leif Hoffman and this is a program I'm working on for one of my classes. For now, I'm calling the program "Deck O Cards" since that's what the program simulates; cards! As of currently, my program has two games that use a standard deck of 52 playing cards, War and Scoundrel. War is a classic game that most people know, but Scoundrel is likely one you haven't heard of. I may plan on adding more games in the future, but hopefully you will enjoy the ones that are currently available!

## About Myself
My name is Leif Hoffman and I'm a computer engineer at Elizabethtown College in PA. Ever since taking a CS I course, I've been enamored by the coding world and have enjoyed making all sorts of programs, from using Python's tKinter to make GUIs to making the game you see here! I usually spend my free time swimming for the team at Etown or playing video games with my friends. Hopefully you enjoy the games I've added!
